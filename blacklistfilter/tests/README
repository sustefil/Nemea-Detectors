The test uses files {testfile_20, testfile_1000} as sources of flows and compares the output/ref_output of the 
ipblacklistfilter using the blacklists below.

All test cases have been revised manually

Blacklists are created the same way as downloader does it (sorting, indexing)

IPV4

ip1.blist - The first three and the last three addresses (mixed src/dst) of testfile_20
ip2.blist - All src addresses of testfile_20
ip3.blist - Some subnets (covering addresses from testfile_1000)
ip4.blist - All (IPv4) addresses collected from the testfile_1000
ip5.blist - Blacklist created by "production" bl_downloader (mixed blacklists from config)

IPV6

ip1.blist - The first found and the last found IPV6 address (one DST, one SRC) of testfile_1000
ip2.blist - All SRC IPV6 of testfile_1000
